# Satellite Tracker

The Department of Physics of the University of Zurich is presently installing a new radio telescope. This antenna should serve educational purposes, giving students the ability to gain first-hand experience in data collection and analysing real astronomical signals. It is meant to be used by high school students and university students and will be able to observe satellites, both in orbit around Earth, as well as spacecraft in deep space and celestial targets like pulsars.

Therefore, an easy-to-use control software is needed that can track targets and orient the antenna automatically with the push of a button.

This thesis aims to develop and test a custom control software for this new radio telescope, which can track deep space and celestial targets as well as Earth satellites and communicate directly with the motor controller of the radio telescope.
